## 🚀 Shipping

**Pulsar Graph Obsidian Plugin** (Launching This Month)
I've been building a graph visualization plugin for Obsidian that reimagines how we explore connected knowledge. Currently in BRAT beta testing phase, preparing for public release in January 2026.

What makes it different: [unique features you're building]

**Tech:** TypeScript, Obsidian API, Graph algorithms
**Status:** BRAT testing, polishing for official release
**Repo:** [Link when public]

## 🏗️ Building

**Camden Environmental Intelligence Platform (CEIP)**
Leading a $8,000-funded project that transforms fragmented environmental data into actionable insights for Camden advocacy organizations. We're building the bridge between EPA violations, PurpleAir sensors, and community action.

Working with the Center for Environmental Transformation (CFET) to ensure our platform serves real community needs, not just tech for tech's sake.

**Tech:** Python, PostgreSQL, Flask, scikit-learn, EPA APIs
**Team:** 8-10 students across CS and Math
**Stage:** MVP development, grant-funded through Spring 2026

**HackRUC 2025**
Organizing Rutgers-Camden's first Major League Hacking-sanctioned hackathon as ACM President. Managing budget, sponsors, logistics, and an 8-person organizing team. 100+ participants expected.

**What's left:** Venue confirmation, finalizing sponsor commitments, registration system
**Event Date:** [Date when confirmed]

**Portfolio Website**
Finally building the public-facing version of my work. Next.js site with blog, project showcases, and my Obsidian notes integrated via Quartz. First blog post will be the Pulsar launch story.

**Tech:** Next.js, Tailwind, MDX, Quartz for blog
**Status:** Cursor is building it right now
**Launch:** End of January 2026

## 🚫 Not Doing Right Now

**Intentionally saying no to:**
- Starting new side projects (shipping existing ones first)
- Social media scrolling (minimized to 15min/day)
- Perfectionism paralysis (done > perfect)
- Waiting for the "right time" to ship (the time is now)

**On hold until summer:**
- Grad school applications (focusing on internships first)
- New research projects (finishing Benford's analysis)
- Learning new frameworks (deepening current stack)

## 💭 Currently Thinking About

**Technical:**
- How to make environmental data truly accessible to non-technical community members
- Local-first AI vs. cloud dependency tradeoffs
- Knowledge management systems that actually work with how brains think
- Infrastructure that scales from homelab to production

**Career:**
- ML Engineering vs. Infrastructure vs. Research Engineering paths
- Building in public as networking strategy
- Converting learning into demonstrable value for employers
- Grad school: PhD vs. Masters vs. industry

**Life:**
- Managing chronic health while staying productive
- Building sustainable work habits (not just grinding)
- Community leadership beyond just coding
- Documenting the messy, real journey (not just highlights)
